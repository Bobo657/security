                    "description": "Practical review of ST-301”SPIDER” capabilities. ST-301”SPIDER” Wire lines Analyzer is designed for checking out any type of wire line including coaxial cables. Please note that this device is designed to detect and localize eavesdropping devices that are galvanically connected to power mains and low-current cables. In the ST 301, passive and active modes of operation are used to detect enabled, switched off, or faulty eavesdropping devices. Let’s stop here for a second. Above I have mentioned that device has “active” and “passive” modes of operation. Meaning that Active mode sends out a signal into the line and then receives a response. Passive on the other hand only receives the signal from the wire line. The advantage of this device is, that it contains 4 devices in one body( not a joke). The main modes of operation are: • Low frequency amplifier • Wire Line receiver • Wire non linear junction detector • Reflectometer That’s 4 different devices in one. Before we begin our review of capabilities of the mentioned device, let us review the data leakage channels. ACOUSTIC CHANNELS - In acoustic channels of information, the distribution environment of speech signals is air, and for their interception high-sensitivity microphones, special pointed microphones are being used, which are connected with special miniature transmitters. Autonomous devices, constructively connected microphones and transmitters are called embedded devices of speech information interception. Intercepted by an embedded device „BUG“ can be transmitted through radio channel, electrical power lines, optical (IR) channel, connected lines of auxiliary means, outsider conductors, engineer communications in ultra-sound frequencies diapason, telephone lines with call from outside telephone client. Reception of information, transmitted by embedded device, is being done, to the special reception devices, working in according diapason of wave lengths. Usage of portable dictaphones and embedded devices requires penetration into the monitored room. Only if there is no possibility to use the directed microphone for interception of speech information. VIBRO-ACOUSTIC CHANNELS – In vibro-acoustic channels of information leakage the distribution environment of speech signals are building constructions( walls, floors, ceilings) and engineered communications (heating systems, ventilation shachts and so on). For interception of speech signals, vibro-sensors (accelerometers) are being used. Vibro sensor connected to the electronic amplifier is called an electronic stethoscope. Electronic stethoscope enables the listening to the speech using head phones and recording to the dictaphone. Through vibro-acoustic channel interception of information using embedded devices is also possible. For transmission of information radio channel is used and the devices are called radio stethoscopes. Also embedded devices with transmission of information through optical channel in the near infrared wavelength diapason and ultrasound devices, are being used (in the engineered communications). ACOUSTOELCTRONIC CHANNELS - Acoustoelectronic channels of information leakage appear using, transformations of acoustic signals in to electronic. Some elements of main technical tools and systems, transformers, induction rolls, electromagnets of secondary electro casts, telephone ring bells and so on, have the ability to change its parameters (capacity, inductivity, resistance) under the influence of acoustic field, created by the origin of the speech signal. Main technical tools and systems can have acoustoelectrical converters. Some types of fire alarms and security detectors, relaying network loudspeakers and so on. The interception of acoustoelectric fluctuations is made through connection lines to main technical tools and systems using high-sensitivity low frequency amplifier. OPTIC-ELECTORNIC (LASER) CHANNEL - Optic-electronic (laser) channel of speech information leakage is made by irradiating using laser beam, of the surface of the reflective surfaces of the premises (window glass, mirrors and so on). The reflected laser emissions are modulated at the amplitude and faze, and received by the laser emission receiver, when modulated speech information can be acquired for interception of which complex laser systems are being used. ACOUSTOELECTROMAGNETIC CHANNEL (Parametric channel) - Acoustoelectromagnetic or as it is also called Parametric information leakage channel, appears in result of the influence of acoustic field to the elements of high frequency generators. As a result of such cables in the induction element (dimension between loops), drossels, places between the air condesator plates and so on., which can result in changes of the parameters of the high frequency signal, for example, modulation of the information signal, high frequency fluctuations can be intercepted and detected by the means of radio surveillance. Parametric channel of information leakage can be made using “high frequency irradiation“ of the premise, where semi-active embedded devices, having elements, some parameters of which (for example: quality and resonance frequency of the voluminous resonator) changes according to the changes of the acoustic (speech) signal. For interception of information through this channel besides the embedded device, special transmitter with directed antenna and receiver, are needed. Usually the typical scheme of an eavesdropping device looks like this: The so called sensor is a microphone receiving the information. Converter (body) is processing unit that processes the received information, converts it in to a signal for a better transmission outside of the controlled premise. There are three types of transmission channels as stated on the scheme. And they are: • Radio channel • Wired channel • Optical infrared channel For detection of eavesdropping devices operating through radio channel and optical channel we have the device called ST-500”Piranha”. For the in-depth checkup of all types of wire lines in the controlled premise it is recommended to use ST-301”SPIDER”. UNMASKING FEATURES In the table listed below You can review the unmasking features of different types of eavesdropping devices. From the above mentioned unmasking features that can be detected using ST-301”SPIDER”,we can underline following: • Heterogenity in the wireline; • Nonlinearity in the wireline; • Voltage in the wireline; • Low frequency signal in the wirelines; • High-frequency signal in the wireline; • HF traffic in the wireline, when the handset is laid. ST-301”SPIDER” Wire line analyzer review of capabilities. The Analyzer is designed to detect and localize eavesdropping devices that are galvanically connected to power mains and low-current cables. In the ST 301, passive and active modes of operation are used to detect enabled, switched off, or faulty eavesdropping devices. Functionally the Analyzer consists of four components (DEVICES): 1. LOW FREQUENCY AMPLIFIER (LFA) 2. WIRE RECEIVER (WR) 3. NON-LINEAR JUNCTION DETECTOR (NLJD) 4. REFLECTOMETER (REF) FUNCTIONALITY: - detection and the analysis of signals cable (dynamic and electret) microphones in low-current cables; - activation of electret cable microphones by giving to the cable of bias voltage for their detection; - detection of signals of the eavesdropping devices transferring information on power mains and low-current cables in frequency range of 100 kHz - 180 MHz; - detection of unauthorized galvanic connections to the cables using a NLJD and the REF; - measurement of AC and DC voltage in the low-current cables.

RJ45 SHORT-CIRCUIT SOCKET This socket (Fig.1, item 17) is used for short circuit of all wires of the cable equipped with the RJ45 connector at its test by NLJD. MINI-USB PATCH CORD Mini-USB patch cord (Fig.1, item 6) is used to connect the main unit to the USB port of a PC. GENERAL INFORMATION SPLITTERS AND ADAPTERS The Analyzer kit contains a set of splitters and adapters used to test various types of cables. Options for their use are described in item #2 (&quot;Connecting to the cables&quot;). POWER SUPPLY The operation of the Analyzer is allowed only from the built-in accumulator. A fully charged accumulator provides the Analyzer operation for 3 hours. The accumulator charge level is shown in the Information line (Fig.22, item 3) on the screen. The accumulator is charged using the charger (Fig.1, item 2). To do this, insert the charger plug into the connector (Fig.2, item 8) on a side panel of the Analyzer and connect the charger to the 220 V / 50 Hz power mains. Charging is followed by a red luminescence of the indicator of connection of the charger (Fig.2, item 7) on a side bar of the Analyzer. Full charge time is not more than 5 hours. When charging is complete, the indicator changes from red to green. It is forbidden to charge the accumulator during operation of the Analyzer! Now let us review the connection of the device to different types of outlets. On this picture You can see the connection of the device to the mains of 220V. Local area networks And many more options of connecting the device to different types is available. Such as connecting the device to a nine pin cable and checking out the SHIELD(ground). Also as previously mentioned device can be used for checking coaxial cables. And many more. More information about the technical capabilities is available in the User manual of the device. Turning ON the device To turn on the device, turn the ON/OFF volume clockwise. While turning You will hear a click and the screen of the device will turn on. On the screen of the device You will see the name of the manufacturer, name of the device, designation and version of the firmware. To enter the mode selection screen press ENTER, afterwards device switches to the mode selection screen. In the upper side of the screen we can see: Time Battery charge Then there are squares with names of the modes, such as: LFA (Low Frequency Amplifier) WR (Wired receiver) NLJD (Wire nonlinear junction detector) REF(Reflectometer) All the above mentioned modes can be entered by pressing F1 F2 F3 or F4 As previously mentioned device has two active channels and two passive channels. Active channels send a signal in to the line and receive the response, the passive channels only receive the incoming signals. In the settings menu following data can be set manually: Date Time Language (English/Russian) LOW FREQUENCY AMPLIFIER mode LFA is designed to detect low-frequency signals of eavesdropping devices in low-current cables. Signal analysis is performing using graphical information (oscillogram or spectrogram) and acoustic information (via headphones or the built-in speaker), but before using this mode it is necessary to select the pair of wires we are going to work with. Device has a built-in electronic switch. Where the operator has the ability to select to the type of the cable and so on. The operational scheme of the LFA looks like this: Following actions are available: Switch setting; connection a pair of wires in the MANUAL mode; gain setting; apply bias voltage to cable; acoustic signal analysis on the connected pair of wires; measurement of values of AC and DC voltage on the connected pair of wires; signal analysis on the connected pair according to the oscillogram and the spectrogram; automatic testing all combinations of wires of the connected cable with a possibility of acoustic signal analysis of each combination. Speaking of which, for example when we looking for, lets say, an electret microphone or a dynamic microphones galvanically connected to the wire line using the LFA mode of the device, we can add BIAS voltage, increase the gain of the receiver and so on. In this test we are going to try and discover it. Following equipment will be used: Test for electret and dynamic microphones (camouflaged as a modem) ST-301”SPIDER” and ST-402”CAYMAN” Wires with RJ45 connectors. TEST 1 1.Turn on the device After the device turns on the screen, you can see following information. 1- Name of the manufacturer 2- Name of the device 3- Device designation 4- Version of the firmware 2. Connect the wireline that is going to be checked, to the device. 3. Turn on the LFA mode by pressing ENTER Or by pressing F1 On the screen You will see a table looking like this 1. Name of the channel 2. Number of pair 3. Battery charge 4. Time 5. Sub modes 6. Highlighted pair 7. Gain 8. Bias voltage controls 9. Number of pairs 10. Voltage DC 11. Voltage AC 4. Press F4 to Scan all 5. If we are looking for electret microphones (microphones that require electricity to operate). After supplying BIAS voltage. If there is an electret microphone present on that pair. On the screen, the operator will see following information. If there are any electronic devices connected to the wire line, on the screen You can observe the consumption of the bias voltage. 6. If you are looking for a dynamic microphone then it is necessary to increase the gain of the Low frequency amplifier. In both cases 5 and 6 for the detection of the mentioned microphones it is necessary to use either the Sound emitter or Non linear junction detector CAYMAN. The technique looks like this: One operator checks the wire line using the ST-301”SPIDER”. Upon the detection of the sound coming from the sound emitter, the other operator takes the sound emitter and walks around the room checking all walls, ceiling, etc. When the operator operating the ST-301”SPIDER” hears that the sound from the sound emitter is getting louder. That means that the operator operating the sound emitter is getting closer to the eavesdropping device. Upon stumbling on the point where the eavesdropping device is located, the ST-301”SPIDER” operator raises his hand to signal the approximate location of the eavesdropping device. The whole process can be seen on the pictures below: One of the operators moves around the room with the acoustic emitter. The other operator is sitting in the room and listen to the selected where the test sound was heard. Upon detection of the location of the supposed eavesdropping device the operator operating ST-301”SPIDER” raises his hand. The process of detection of the eavesdropping device location using ST-301”SPIDER” and ST-402”CAYMAN” is similar to the previously described technique. There are two operators one operates ST-301”SPIDER” and the other operates ST-402”CAYMAN”. Please note that when practicing this technique it is unnecessary to turn up the volume of ST-402”CAYMAN”. Afterwards the operator operating the ST-402”CAYMAN” checks the room and upon detection of the location of the eavesdropping device the operator operating the ST-301”SPIDER” raises his hand up to signalize the detection of the location of the eavesdropping device. Afterwards the operator operating the ST-402”CAYMAN” can check where the eavesdropping device actually is. Please note that there are three connection types that may occur while checking the wirelines The first connection type is parallel connection, the eavesdropping devices is supposedly connected to two wires. One is + another one is -. The only variable in this type of connection is polarity. In the ST-301”SPIDER” LFA mode, the operator has the opportunity to change the polarity of BIAS voltage, therefore activate the supposed electret eavesdropping device. Next connection type is Continuous connection. This connection type utilizes only one wire. Meaning the supposed eavesdropping device can be connected to one wire (both + and -). In this case when detecting such connections, it is necessary to close the circuit. In the delivery set of the ST-301”SPIDER” there is a special connector marked with red band in the middle (nr.17 in the delivery)The last connection type is Exotic connection in this case the supposed eavesdropping device uses cable shield as a second wire in a circuit. Meaning that one part of the power supply of the eavesdropping device connected to the wire and another part connected to a 9th cable or a cable shield. One the pictures 5A, 5B, etc. we can see the checking of such type of connection. More information about testing of ST-301&quot;SPIDER&quot; capabilities, You can find in our other publication, listed below: https://www.selcomsecurity.com/en/our-publications/item/724-review-of-use-of-st-301-spider-when-checking-wired-communications-in-the-typical-office-premise",
                    "articleBody": "Practical review of ST-301”SPIDER” capabilities. ST-301”SPIDER” Wire lines Analyzer is designed for checking out any type of wire line including coaxial cables. Please note that this device is designed to detect and localize eavesdropping devices that are galvanically connected to power mains and low-current cables. In the ST 301, passive and active modes of operation are used to detect enabled, switched off, or faulty eavesdropping devices. Let’s stop here for a second. Above I have mentioned that device has “active” and “passive” modes of operation. Meaning that Active mode sends out a signal into the line and then receives a response. Passive on the other hand only receives the signal from the wire line. The advantage of this device is, that it contains 4 devices in one body( not a joke). The main modes of operation are: • Low frequency amplifier • Wire Line receiver • Wire non linear junction detector • Reflectometer That’s 4 different devices in one. Before we begin our review of capabilities of the mentioned device, let us review the data leakage channels. ACOUSTIC CHANNELS - In acoustic channels of information, the distribution environment of speech signals is air, and for their interception high-sensitivity microphones, special pointed microphones are being used, which are connected with special miniature transmitters. Autonomous devices, constructively connected microphones and transmitters are called embedded devices of speech information interception. Intercepted by an embedded device „BUG“ can be transmitted through radio channel, electrical power lines, optical (IR) channel, connected lines of auxiliary means, outsider conductors, engineer communications in ultra-sound frequencies diapason, telephone lines with call from outside telephone client. Reception of information, transmitted by embedded device, is being done, to the special reception devices, working in according diapason of wave lengths. Usage of portable dictaphones and embedded devices requires penetration into the monitored room. Only if there is no possibility to use the directed microphone for interception of speech information. VIBRO-ACOUSTIC CHANNELS – In vibro-acoustic channels of information leakage the distribution environment of speech signals are building constructions( walls, floors, ceilings) and engineered communications (heating systems, ventilation shachts and so on). For interception of speech signals, vibro-sensors (accelerometers) are being used. Vibro sensor connected to the electronic amplifier is called an electronic stethoscope. Electronic stethoscope enables the listening to the speech using head phones and recording to the dictaphone. Through vibro-acoustic channel interception of information using embedded devices is also possible. For transmission of information radio channel is used and the devices are called radio stethoscopes. Also embedded devices with transmission of information through optical channel in the near infrared wavelength diapason and ultrasound devices, are being used (in the engineered communications). ACOUSTOELCTRONIC CHANNELS - Acoustoelectronic channels of information leakage appear using, transformations of acoustic signals in to electronic. Some elements of main technical tools and systems, transformers, induction rolls, electromagnets of secondary electro casts, telephone ring bells and so on, have the ability to change its parameters (capacity, inductivity, resistance) under the influence of acoustic field, created by the origin of the speech signal. Main technical tools and systems can have acoustoelectrical converters. Some types of fire alarms and security detectors, relaying network loudspeakers and so on. The interception of acoustoelectric fluctuations is made through connection lines to main technical tools and systems using high-sensitivity low frequency amplifier. OPTIC-ELECTORNIC (LASER) CHANNEL - Optic-electronic (laser) channel of speech information leakage is made by irradiating using laser beam, of the surface of the reflective surfaces of the premises (window glass, mirrors and so on). The reflected laser emissions are modulated at the amplitude and faze, and received by the laser emission receiver, when modulated speech information can be acquired for interception of which complex laser systems are being used. ACOUSTOELECTROMAGNETIC CHANNEL (Parametric channel) - Acoustoelectromagnetic or as it is also called Parametric information leakage channel, appears in result of the influence of acoustic field to the elements of high frequency generators. As a result of such cables in the induction element (dimension between loops), drossels, places between the air condesator plates and so on., which can result in changes of the parameters of the high frequency signal, for example, modulation of the information signal, high frequency fluctuations can be intercepted and detected by the means of radio surveillance. Parametric channel of information leakage can be made using “high frequency irradiation“ of the premise, where semi-active embedded devices, having elements, some parameters of which (for example: quality and resonance frequency of the voluminous resonator) changes according to the changes of the acoustic (speech) signal. For interception of information through this channel besides the embedded device, special transmitter with directed antenna and receiver, are needed. Usually the typical scheme of an eavesdropping device looks like this: The so called sensor is a microphone receiving the information. Converter (body) is processing unit that processes the received information, converts it in to a signal for a better transmission outside of the controlled premise. There are three types of transmission channels as stated on the scheme. And they are: • Radio channel • Wired channel • Optical infrared channel For detection of eavesdropping devices operating through radio channel and optical channel we have the device called ST-500”Piranha”. For the in-depth checkup of all types of wire lines in the controlled premise it is recommended to use ST-301”SPIDER”. UNMASKING FEATURES In the table listed below You can review the unmasking features of different types of eavesdropping devices. From the above mentioned unmasking features that can be detected using ST-301”SPIDER”,we can underline following: • Heterogenity in the wireline; • Nonlinearity in the wireline; • Voltage in the wireline; • Low frequency signal in the wirelines; • High-frequency signal in the wireline; • HF traffic in the wireline, when the handset is laid. ST-301”SPIDER” Wire line analyzer review of capabilities. The Analyzer is designed to detect and localize eavesdropping devices that are galvanically connected to power mains and low-current cables.

GENERAL INFORMATION SPLITTERS AND ADAPTERS The Analyzer kit contains a set of splitters and adapters used to test various types of cables. Options for their use are described in item #2 (&quot;Connecting to the cables&quot;). POWER SUPPLY The operation of the Analyzer is allowed only from the built-in accumulator. A fully charged accumulator provides the Analyzer operation for 3 hours. The accumulator charge level is shown in the Information line (Fig.22, item 3) on the screen. The accumulator is charged using the charger (Fig.1, item 2). To do this, insert the charger plug into the connector (Fig.2, item 8) on a side panel of the Analyzer and connect the charger to the 220 V / 50 Hz power mains. Charging is followed by a red luminescence of the indicator of connection of the charger (Fig.2, item 7) on a side bar of the Analyzer. Full charge time is not more than 5 hours. When charging is complete, the indicator changes from red to green. It is forbidden to charge the accumulator during operation of the Analyzer! Now let us review the connection of the device to different types of outlets. On this picture You can see the connection of the device to the mains of 220V. Local area networks And many more options of connecting the device to different types is available. Such as connecting the device to a nine pin cable and checking out the SHIELD(ground). Also as previously mentioned device can be used for checking coaxial cables. And many more. More information about the technical capabilities is available in the User manual of the device. Turning ON the device To turn on the device, turn the ON/OFF volume clockwise. While turning You will hear a click and the screen of the device will turn on. On the screen of the device You will see the name of the manufacturer, name of the device, designation and version of the firmware. To enter the mode selection screen press ENTER, afterwards device switches to the mode selection screen. In the upper side of the screen we can see: Time Battery charge Then there are squares with names of the modes, such as: LFA (Low Frequency Amplifier) WR (Wired receiver) NLJD (Wire nonlinear junction detector) REF(Reflectometer) All the above mentioned modes can be entered by pressing F1 F2 F3 or F4 As previously mentioned device has two active channels and two passive channels. Active channels send a signal in to the line and receive the response, the passive channels only receive the incoming signals. In the settings menu following data can be set manually: Date Time Language (English/Russian) LOW FREQUENCY AMPLIFIER mode LFA is designed to detect low-frequency signals of eavesdropping devices in low-current cables. Signal analysis is performing using graphical information (oscillogram or spectrogram) and acoustic information (via headphones or the built-in speaker), but before using this mode it is necessary to select the pair of wires we are going to work with. Device has a built-in electronic switch. Where the operator has the ability to select to the type of the cable and so on. The operational scheme of the LFA looks like this: Following actions are available: Switch setting; connection a pair of wires in the MANUAL mode; gain setting; apply bias voltage to cable; acoustic signal analysis on the connected pair of wires; measurement of values of AC and DC voltage on the connected pair of wires; signal analysis on the connected pair according to the oscillogram and the spectrogram; automatic testing all combinations of wires of the connected cable with a possibility of acoustic signal analysis of each combination. Speaking of which, for example when we looking for, lets say, an electret microphone or a dynamic microphones galvanically connected to the wire line using the LFA mode of the device, we can add BIAS voltage, increase the gain of the receiver and so on. In this test we are going to try and discover it. Following equipment will be used: Test for electret and dynamic microphones (camouflaged as a modem) ST-301”SPIDER” and ST-402”CAYMAN” Wires with RJ45 connectors. TEST 1 1.Turn on the device After the device turns on the screen, you can see following information. 1- Name of the manufacturer 2- Name of the device 3- Device designation 4- Version of the firmware 2. Connect the wireline that is going to be checked, to the device. 3. Turn on the LFA mode by pressing ENTER Or by pressing F1 On the screen You will see a table looking like this 1. Name of the channel 2. Number of pair 3. Battery charge 4. Time 5. Sub modes 6. Highlighted pair 7. Gain 8. Bias voltage controls 9. Number of pairs 10. Voltage DC 11. Voltage AC 4. Press F4 to Scan all 5. If we are looking for electret microphones (microphones that require electricity to operate). After supplying BIAS voltage. If there is an electret microphone present on that pair. On the screen, the operator will see following information. If there are any electronic devices connected to the wire line, on the screen You can observe the consumption of the bias voltage. 6. If you are looking for a dynamic microphone then it is necessary to increase the gain of the Low frequency amplifier. In both cases 5 and 6 for the detection of the mentioned microphones it is necessary to use either the Sound emitter or Non linear junction detector CAYMAN. The technique looks like this: One operator checks the wire line using the ST-301”SPIDER”.

Please note that this device is designed to detect and localize eavesdropping devices that are galvanically connected to power mains and low-current cables.<br /> In the ST 301, passive and active modes of operation are used to detect enabled, switched off, or faulty eavesdropping devices.&nbsp;Let’s stop here for a second. Above I have mentioned that device has “active” and “passive” modes of operation. Meaning that Active mode sends out a signal into the line and then receives a response. Passive on the other hand only receives the signal from the wire line. <br /><br /> The advantage of this device is, that it contains 4 devices in one body( not a joke). The main modes of operation are: <br /> <span style="color: #434343; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #fcfcfc;">•&nbsp;</span>Low frequency amplifier<br /> <span style="color: #434343; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #fcfcfc;">•&nbsp;</span>Wire Line receiver<br /> <span style="color: #434343; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #fcfcfc;">•&nbsp;</span>Wire non linear junction detector<br /> <span style="color: #434343; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #fcfcfc;">•&nbsp;</span>Reflectometer<br /><br /> That’s 4 different devices in one. <br /><br /> Before we begin our review of capabilities of the mentioned device, let us review the data leakage channels.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ACOUSTIC CHANNELS</strong> - In acoustic channels of information, the distribution environment of speech signals is air, and for their interception high-sensitivity microphones, special pointed microphones are being used, which are connected with special miniature transmitters. Autonomous devices, constructively connected microphones and transmitters are called embedded devices of speech information interception. Intercepted by an embedded device „BUG“ can be transmitted through radio channel, electrical power lines, optical (IR) channel, connected lines of auxiliary means, outsider conductors, engineer communications in ultra-sound frequencies diapason, telephone lines with call from outside telephone client. Reception of information, transmitted by embedded device, is being done, to the special reception devices, working in according diapason of wave lengths. Usage of portable dictaphones and embedded devices requires penetration into the monitored room. Only if there is no possibility to use the directed microphone for interception of speech information.<br /> <strong>VIBRO-ACOUSTIC CHANNELS</strong> – In vibro-acoustic channels of information leakage the distribution environment of speech signals are building constructions( walls, floors, ceilings) and engineered communications (heating systems, ventilation shachts and so on). For interception of speech signals, vibro-sensors (accelerometers) are being used. Vibro sensor connected to the electronic amplifier is called an electronic stethoscope. Electronic stethoscope enables the listening to the speech using head phones and recording to the dictaphone. Through vibro-acoustic channel interception of information using embedded devices is also possible. For transmission of information radio channel is used and the devices are called radio stethoscopes. Also embedded devices with transmission of information through optical channel in the near infrared wavelength diapason and ultrasound devices, are being used (in the engineered communications).<br /> <strong>ACOUSTOELCTRONIC CHANNELS</strong> - Acoustoelectronic channels of information leakage appear using, transformations of acoustic signals in to electronic. Some elements of main technical tools and systems, transformers, induction rolls, electromagnets of secondary electro casts, telephone ring bells and so on, have the ability to change its parameters (capacity, inductivity, resistance) under the influence of acoustic field, created by the origin of the speech signal. Main technical tools and systems can have acoustoelectrical converters. Some types of fire alarms and security detectors, relaying network loudspeakers and so on. The interception of acoustoelectric fluctuations is made through connection lines to main technical tools and systems using high-sensitivity low frequency amplifier.<br /> <strong>OPTIC-ELECTORNIC (LASER) CHANNEL</strong> - Optic-electronic (laser) channel of speech information leakage is made by irradiating using laser beam, of the surface of the reflective surfaces of the premises (window glass, mirrors and so on). The reflected laser emissions are modulated at the amplitude and faze, and received by the laser emission receiver, when modulated speech information can be acquired for interception of which complex laser systems are being used. <br /> <strong>ACOUSTOELECTROMAGNETIC CHANNEL</strong> (Parametric channel) - Acoustoelectromagnetic or as it is also called Parametric information leakage channel, appears in result of the influence of acoustic field to the elements of high frequency generators. As a result of such cables in the induction element (dimension between loops), drossels, places between the air condesator plates and so on., which can result in changes of the parameters of the high frequency signal, for example, modulation of the information signal, high frequency fluctuations can be intercepted and detected by the means of radio surveillance.<br /><br /> Parametric channel of information leakage can be made using “high frequency irradiation“ of the premise, where semi-active embedded devices, having elements, some parameters of which (for example: quality and resonance frequency of the voluminous resonator) changes according to the changes of the acoustic (speech) signal. For interception of information through this channel besides the embedded device, special transmitter with directed antenna and receiver, are needed. <br /><br /> Usually the typical scheme of an eavesdropping device looks like this:</div>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/TE1.bmp" alt="TE1" /></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The so called sensor is a microphone receiving the information. Converter (body) is processing unit that processes the received information, converts it in to a signal for a better transmission outside of the controlled premise. There are three types of transmission channels as stated on the scheme. And they are:<br /> <span style="color: #434343; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #fcfcfc;">•&nbsp;</span>Radio channel<br /> <span style="color: #434343; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #fcfcfc;">•&nbsp;</span>Wired channel<br /> <span style="color: #434343; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #fcfcfc;">•&nbsp;</span>Optical infrared channel<br /><br /> For detection of eavesdropping devices operating through radio channel and optical channel we have the device called ST-500”Piranha”. For the in-depth checkup of all types of wire lines in the controlled premise it is recommended to use ST-301”SPIDER”. <br /><br /> UNMASKING FEATURES<br /> In the table listed below You can review the unmasking features of different types of eavesdropping devices.</div>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/TE2.bmp" alt="TE2" /></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">From the above mentioned unmasking features that can be detected using ST-301”SPIDER”,we can underline following: <br /><br /> <span style="color: #434343; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #fcfcfc;">•&nbsp;</span>Heterogenity in the wireline;<br /> <span style="color: #434343; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #fcfcfc;">•&nbsp;</span>Nonlinearity in the wireline;<br /> <span style="color: #434343; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #fcfcfc;">•&nbsp;</span>Voltage in the wireline;<br /> <span style="color: #434343; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #fcfcfc;">•&nbsp;</span>Low frequency signal in the wirelines;<br /> <span style="color: #434343; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #fcfcfc;">•&nbsp;</span>High-frequency signal in the wireline;<br /> <span style="color: #434343; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #fcfcfc;">•&nbsp;</span>HF traffic in the wireline, when the handset is laid.</div>

It connects to the "SHIELD" connector of the main unit. On the wire there is a pin plug and a needle probe. The needle pierces the outer insulation of the cable under test and provides contact with the screen. <br /> <strong>ADAPTER FOR CONNECTING TO THE MULTI-WIRE CABLE </strong><br /> The adapter (Fig.1, item 18) is used to connect low-current cables with no connectors. When connecting such cables (twisted pair type), it is recommended to take into account the color scheme of wires of a cable (item 10.3). <br /> <strong>PLAYER OF THE TEST SOUND (PTS) </strong><br /> PTS purpose (Fig.1, item 3): <br /> &nbsp;-creation of obviously known acoustic signal. Listening of this signal by means of ST 301 means existence in the room of the active eavesdropping device with an uncoded transmission channel; <br /> &nbsp;-turning on of eavesdropping devices equipped with the VOX activation option; <br /> - creation of "the masking noise" during the testing; <br /> PTS used a removable USB-drive. The user can record the sound files (music, people talking, machinery noise), which are optimum corresponding to specifics of a testing. <br /> Charging is carried out by means of a cable (Fig.1, item 4). <br /> <strong>RJ45 SHORT-CIRCUIT SOCKET </strong><br /> This socket (Fig.1, item 17) is used for short circuit of all wires of the cable equipped with the RJ45 connector at its test by NLJD. <br /> <strong>MINI-USB PATCH CORD </strong><br /> Mini-USB patch cord (Fig.1, item 6) is used to connect the main unit to the USB port of a PC. GENERAL INFORMATION <br /> <strong>SPLITTERS AND ADAPTERS </strong><br /> The Analyzer kit contains a set of splitters and adapters used to test various types of cables. Options for their use are described in item #2 ("Connecting to the cables"). <br /> <strong>POWER SUPPLY </strong><br /> <strong>The operation of the Analyzer is allowed only from the built-in accumulator. </strong>A fully charged accumulator provides the Analyzer operation for 3 hours. The accumulator charge level is shown in the Information line (Fig.22, item 3) on the screen. The accumulator is charged using the charger (Fig.1, item 2). To do this, insert the charger plug into the connector (Fig.2, item 8) on a side panel of the Analyzer and connect the charger to the 220 V / 50 Hz power mains. Charging is followed by a red luminescence of the indicator of connection of the charger (Fig.2, item 7) on a side bar of the Analyzer. Full charge time is not more than 5 hours. When charging is complete, the indicator changes from red to green. <br /><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It is forbidden to charge the accumulator during operation of the Analyzer!</strong></span><br /><br /> Now let us review the connection of the device to different types of outlets.&nbsp;On this picture You can see the connection of the device to the mains of 220V.</div>

<p>&nbsp;On the screen You will see a table looking like this&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/TE12.bmp" alt="TE12" width="510" height="389" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1.<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><strong>Name of the channel</strong><br /> <strong>2.<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><strong>Number of pair</strong><br /> <strong>3.<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><strong>Battery charge</strong><br /> <strong>4.<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><strong>Time</strong><br /> <strong>5.<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><strong>Sub modes</strong><br /> <strong>6.<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><strong>Highlighted pair</strong><br /> <strong>7.<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><strong>Gain</strong><br /> <strong>8.<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><strong>Bias voltage controls</strong><br /> <strong>9.<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><strong>Number of pairs</strong><br /> <strong>10.<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><strong>Voltage DC</strong><br /> <strong>11.<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><strong>Voltage AC</strong><br /><br /> 4. Press F4 to Scan all<br /> 5. If we are looking for electret microphones (microphones that require electricity to operate). After supplying BIAS voltage. If there is an electret microphone present on that pair. On the screen, the operator will see following information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/1593596372356.jpg" alt="1593596372356" width="572" height="406" /></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">If there are any electronic devices connected to the wire line, on the screen You can observe the consumption of the bias voltage. <br /><br /> 6. If you are looking for a dynamic microphone then it is necessary to increase the gain of the Low frequency amplifier.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In both cases 5 and 6 for the detection of the mentioned microphones it is necessary to use either the Sound emitter or Non linear junction detector CAYMAN. <br /> The technique looks like this:<br /><br /> <strong>One operator checks the wire line using the ST-301”SPIDER”. Upon the detection of the sound coming from the sound emitter, the other operator takes the sound emitter and walks around the room checking all walls, ceiling, etc. </strong><br /> <strong>When the operator operating the ST-301”SPIDER” hears that the sound from the sound emitter is getting louder. That means that the operator operating the sound emitter is getting closer to the eavesdropping device.&nbsp; Upon stumbling on the point where the eavesdropping device is located, the ST-301”SPIDER” operator raises his hand to signal the approximate location of the eavesdropping device. </strong><br /> <strong>The whole process can be seen on the pictures below:&nbsp;</strong></div>
<p><strong><img src="../../../images/1593596430135.jpg" alt="1593596430135" width="584" height="438" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>One of the operators moves around the room with the acoustic emitter.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../images/1593596430164.jpg" alt="1593596430164" width="588" height="441" /></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The other operator is sitting in the room and listen to the selected where the test sound was heard.</span></strong></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Upon detection of the location of the supposed eavesdropping device the operator operating ST-301”SPIDER” raises his hand.</span></strong></div>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><img src="../../../images/1593596430191.jpg" alt="1593596430191" width="592" height="526" /></span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The process of detection of the eavesdropping device location using ST-301”SPIDER” and ST-402”CAYMAN” is similar to the previously described technique.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">There are two operators one operates ST-301”SPIDER” and the other operates ST-402”CAYMAN”. Please note that when practicing this technique it is unnecessary to turn up the volume of ST-402”CAYMAN”. Afterwards the operator operating the ST-402”CAYMAN” checks the room and upon detection of the location of the eavesdropping device the operator operating&nbsp;the ST-301”SPIDER” raises his hand up to signalize the detection of the location of the eavesdropping device. Afterwards the operator operating the ST-402”CAYMAN”&nbsp;can check where the eavesdropping device actually is.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /> Please note that there are three connection types that may occur while checking the wirelines</div>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/TF13.bmp" alt="TF13" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first connection type is parallel connection, the eavesdropping devices is supposedly connected to two wires. One is + another one is -. The only variable in this type of connection is polarity. In the ST-301”SPIDER” LFA mode, the operator has the opportunity to change the polarity of BIAS voltage, therefore activate the supposed electret eavesdropping device. <br />Next connection type is Continuous connection. This connection type utilizes only one wire. Meaning the supposed eavesdropping device can be connected to one wire (both + and -). In this case when detecting such connections, it is necessary to close the circuit. In the delivery set of the ST-301”SPIDER” there is a special connector marked with red band in the middle (nr.17 in the delivery)<br />The last connection type is Exotic connection in this case the supposed eavesdropping device uses cable shield as a second wire in a circuit. Meaning that one part of the power supply of the eavesdropping device connected to the wire and another part connected to a 9th cable or a cable shield. One the pictures 5A, 5B, etc. we can see the checking of such type of connection. <br />More information about testing of ST-301"SPIDER" capabilities, You can find in our other publication, listed below:</p>
