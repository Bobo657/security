                    "description": "History of Audio recording and Ultroasound suppression. Thomas Eddison invented and patented his Phonograph a long time ago, but he did not suspect that in the near future his invention would be used for covert sound recording in the meetings during negotiations. Sound recording via Thomas Eddisons phonograph. A bit of History Edison&#039;s major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab in 1876. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township (now named Edison Township in his honor) in Middlesex County, New Jersey, with the funds from the sale of Edison&#039;s quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($226,000 in today&#039;s dollars), which he gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison&#039;s first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results. William Joseph Hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under general manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was &quot;a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting&quot;. Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer, was recruited by Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague&#039;s contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison&#039;s mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm&#039;s Law, Joule&#039;s Law and economics. Nearly all of Edison&#039;s patents were utility patents, which were protected for 17 years and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to 14 years. As in most patents, the inventions he described were improvements over prior art. The phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented in describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds. In just over a decade, Edison&#039;s Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have &quot;a stock of almost every conceivable material&quot;. A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained &quot;eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels ... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark&#039;s teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell ... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock&#039;s tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores ...&quot; and the list goes on. Over his desk Edison displayed a placard with Sir Joshua Reynolds&#039; famous quotation: &quot;There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.&quot; This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility. In Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application. Edison&#039;s name is registered on 1,093 patents. Edison began his career as an inventor in Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877. This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as &quot;The Wizard of Menlo Park,&quot; New Jersey. His first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as &quot;the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other&quot;. In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and US President Hayes. The Washington Post described Edison as a &quot;genius&quot; and his presentation as &quot;a scene... that will live in history&quot;. Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878, he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders. On the picture below You can see how a phonograph works. Artwork: Edison&#039;s iPod! How did the phonograph work? If you want to record sound, you speak into the tube (1). The sound energy from yourvoice makes a diaphragm (like a mini drumskin) vibrate, pushing a needle (2) back and forth and cutting a groove into some metal foil wrapped around a cylinder (3), which is slowly turned by a clockwork (wind-up) motor. Playback runs this process in reverse. Another needle (4) presses into the groove, bouncing up and down in the pattern previously cut there. Another diaphragm and horn (5) amplify the sounds and turn them back into sounds you can hear. Artwork courtesy of US Patent and Trademark Office (coloring and numbering added). Let us get back to our time and review the modern audio recorders. Please note that with years different parts of the voice recorder were upgraded, simplified and replaced and downsized. So with that the voice recorders became smaller, more compact and being able to record for longer periods. Here are some examples Up today, the protection of negotiations are carried out using specialized devices such as: Vibro acoustic protection systems Noise generators for mains Ultrasonic microphones suppressors And many more In this publication, we are going to review Ultrasonic microphones suppressors such as SEL-324A”Spot” SEL-324V”Slim” SEL-360”Omni” SEL-310”Komar” However, before we start reviewing them. Let us review what the Ultrasound actually is: A slightly more technical and humane solution is ultrasound. Some microphones are so sensitive that they even record ultrasound. Therefore, by applying a powerful ULTRASONIC signal, you can jam the recording. The trick of ultrasound is that it is not audible to the naked ear (although some hear it, it looks like the sounds of a mosquito buzzing around the ear). You can use this to create hidden voice recorder suppression. But the distance and the fabric are a problem for such suppression. So if you have your mobile phone turned on in your inner pocket and you are at a distance of more than 1-2 meters from the ultrasound source, it may not affect the voice recorder. Much depends on the type of voice recorder. First device that we are going to review is SEL-324A a ceiling mounted microphones suppressor. Device is mounted in the ceiling and positioned at the spot where the possible person with an audio recorder is going to sit. This is a primitive schematic how the mounted SEL-324A operation looks like. Operation of SEL-324V”Slim” is a bit different form the 324A” Spot”. Device can be positioned facing towards the target, but also can be concealed under the table SEL-324V”Slim” has a wide angle of suppression 180 degrees. On this picture it is situated on the table On this picture it is situated underneath the table SEL 360”Omni” has a radial diagram of suppression with 360 degrees angle. SEL-310”Komar” is portable microphones jammer and can be concealed in a carry bag, etc.",

									<p>History of Audio recording and Ultroasound suppression. <br /><br /> Thomas Eddison invented and patented his Phonograph a long time ago, but he did not suspect that in the near future his invention would be used for covert sound recording in the meetings during negotiations.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Ultra_1.bmp" alt="Ultra_1" /><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Sound recording via Thomas Eddisons phonograph.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">A bit of History<br /><br /> Edison's major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab in 1876. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township (now named Edison Township in his honor) in Middlesex County, New Jersey, with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($226,000 in today's dollars), which he gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.<br /><br /> William Joseph Hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under general manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was "a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting". Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer, was recruited by Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague's contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison's mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm's Law, Joule's Law and economics.<br /><br /> Nearly all of Edison's patents were utility patents, which were protected for 17 years and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to 14 years. As in most patents, the inventions he described were improvements over prior art. The phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented in describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds.<br /><br /> In just over a decade, Edison's Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have "a stock of almost every conceivable material". A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained "eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels ... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark's teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell ... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock's tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores ..." and the list goes on.<br /><br /> Over his desk Edison displayed a placard with Sir Joshua Reynolds' famous quotation: "There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking." This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility.<br /><br /> In Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application. Edison's name is registered on 1,093 patents.<br /><br /> Edison began his career as an inventor in Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877. This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as "The Wizard of Menlo Park," New Jersey.<br /><br /> His first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as "the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other". In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and US President Hayes. The Washington Post described Edison as a "genius" and his presentation as "a scene... that will live in history". Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878, he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #222222; background: #f8f8f8;">Let us get back to our time and review the modern audio recorders. <br /><br /> Please note that with years different parts of the voice recorder were upgraded, simplified and replaced and downsized. <br /><br /> So with that the voice recorders became smaller, more compact and being able to record for longer periods. <br /><br /> Here are some examples</span></em></p>

<p>Up today, the protection of negotiations are carried out using specialized devices such as: <br /><br /> Vibro acoustic protection systems <br /><br /> Noise generators for mains <br /><br /> Ultrasonic microphones suppressors <br /><br /> And many more <br /><br /> In this publication, we are going to review Ultrasonic microphones suppressors such as <br /><br /> SEL-324A”Spot”<br /><br /> SEL-324V”Slim”<br /><br /> SEL-360”Omni”<br /><br /> SEL-310”Komar”</p>
<p>However, before we start reviewing them. Let us review what the Ultrasound actually is:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Ultra_5.bmp" alt="Ultra_5" /></p>
<p>A slightly more technical and humane solution is ultrasound. Some microphones are so sensitive that they even record ultrasound. Therefore, by applying a powerful ULTRASONIC signal, you can jam the recording. The trick of ultrasound is that it is not audible to the naked ear (although some hear it, it looks like the sounds of a mosquito buzzing around the ear). You can use this to create hidden voice recorder suppression. But the distance and the fabric are a problem for such suppression. So if you have your mobile phone turned on in your inner pocket and you are at a distance of more than 1-2 meters from the ultrasound source, it may not affect the voice recorder. Much depends on the type of voice recorder.<br /><br /> First device that we are going to review is SEL-324A a ceiling mounted microphones suppressor. <br /><br /> <span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Device is mounted in the ceiling and positioned at the spot where the possible person with an audio recorder is going to sit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Ultra_6.bmp" alt="Ultra_6" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a primitive schematic how the mounted SEL-324A operation looks like.<br /><br /> Operation of SEL-324V”Slim” is a bit different form the 324A” Spot”. Device can be positioned facing towards the target, but also can be concealed under the table <br /><br /> SEL-324V”Slim” has a wide angle of suppression 180 degrees.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Ultra_7.bmp" alt="Ultra_7" /></p>
<p>On this picture it is situated on the table</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Ultra_8.bmp" alt="Ultra_8" /></p>
<p>On this picture it is situated underneath the table</p>
<p>SEL 360”Omni” has a radial diagram of suppression with 360 degrees angle.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Ultra_9.bmp" alt="Ultra_9" /></p>
<p>SEL-310”Komar” is portable microphones jammer and can be concealed in a carry bag, etc.</p>
