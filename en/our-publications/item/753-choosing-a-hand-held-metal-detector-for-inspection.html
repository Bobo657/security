                    "description": "CHOOSING A HAND-HELD METAL DETECTOR FOR INSPECTION IntroductionHistory The history of hand-held metal detectors goes back to the late 19th century, when a revolver wounded 20th President of the United States of America, James Abraham Garfield, in 1881. The bullet was lodged in the president’s body, and doctors could not determine its location. Then doctors turned to the scientist Alexander Graham Bell for help, who especially for searching for a bullet, created a first hand-made metal detector. 130 Years have passed since that time, the electronic industry has underwent a couple of industrial revolutions, but the principle of operation has remained the same. The principle of operation The majority of hand-held metal detector for inspection use the electromagnetic induction and the effect of vortex currents, the essence of which is as follows. The metal detector creates a primary variable electromagnetic field harmless for human. Upon appearance in the primary electromagnetic of an electro-conductive (metal) object in it, the vortex currents create a secondary electromagnetic field, which interacts with the primary one. This change of the electromagnetic field is registered by an electronic scheme and the signal of detection of a metallic object is given out.Usage Up today, hand-held metal detectors are used in many spheres of our lives. For example, in medicine when there is no possibility of conduction of MRI, using hand-held metal detectors unidentified metallic objects can be located in the body of the patient. In archeology and treasure, hunting hand-held metal detectors are used widely for detection of potentially valuable metallic objects in the low conductive environments and soil. In criminalistics metal detectors are used for evidence search and other metallic objects, that can used for successful crime solution. As well, metal detectors are Indespensible in the construction works, for example, in detection of metal wiring in the engineered construction. But the most popular field of use of the hand-held metal detectors is, the ensuring the safety of objects and mass events. With the help of hand-held metal detectors, citizens and their personal belongings are searched in order to identify prohibited metal objects. In addition, the inspection with the use of manual metal detectors is carried out by security guards at passageways of enterprises where there is a high probability of theft of products or production materials( for example, gold mining and gold procession plants/ jewelry companies or companies specializing in production of copper wire). The quality of the inspection is influenced by two key factors: the responsibility of the operator performing the inspection, and the combination of technical and operational characteristics of the hand-held metal detector used. Each of the factors deserves detailed consideration, but in this article we will focus on the latter (for effective use of manual metal detectors, read the rules of inspection in our article &quot;methods of inspection with a manual metal detector&quot;). Depending on the task to be solved during the inspection, the approach to choosing the inspection tool is very important. Let&#039;s find out how to choose a manual metal detector for a specific inspection task that provides the highest quality result at the lowest expense.Technical and exploitation characteristics Any hand-held metal detectors have a variety of technical and exploitation characteristics, which make it usable or unusable for checking in certain situations. Every supplier or seller tries to win over his customer by any means. Sometimes these means are pointed towards confusing of the consumer. The declared by the manufacturer or supplier advantages, at work can be significant disadvantages, that mess with conduction of qualitative checkup. Which of the many characteristics should you pay attention to when choosing a hand-held metal detector?Types of search elements (SE) and durability of the case The search element (primary converter) of the hand- one or several inductors, answering for generation of the electromagnetic field and its fluctuations. Search element as a rule, is set in a separate part of the case of the metal detector and determines its’ area of control (sensitivity diagram) – area of surface of the checked object, covered by the electromagnetic field of the metal detector. Construction of the case and exterior design of the hand-held metal detector, most likely, depends on the type of search element. Up today, the most common types of SE, are: flat elongated, flat round and cylindrical. On pic. 1 shown diagrams of sensitivity for different types of SE. flat elongated flat round Cylindrical cylindrical shortened Pic.1 Types of search elements with sensitivity diagram. As can see, the flat SE have the uneven sensitivity diagram: low frontal sensitivity, high- in direction perpendicular to its flatness. The cylindrical SE has an equal sensitivity diagram around the metal detector case (360°). Besides, current type of SE after detection of the object with a side part of the metal detector, to pinpoint its’ location using the front side. But in overall absolute results at the same length of the SE, the sensitivity of the metal detector with a cylindrical SE is lower, than the flat. That is why the modern high-sensitivity metal detectors are made with flat SE (for example Vortex metal detectors) As mentioned above, the design of the SE defines the control zone of the metal detector, which influences the productivity of the checkup. The wider the control zone, the higher the production. For example, to check a person from the front, using the metal detector with flat elongated SE, it is necessary to make only two passes (pic. 2). a) Flat elongated b) Flat round c)cylindrical d)cylindrical shortened Pic.2 Productivity of checkup using hand-held metal detectors with different types of SE To check out the person from the front using flat round SE three rounds are required( pic.2b) , and if use a compact metal detector with short cylindrical SE – four rounds are necessary (pic.2c). That is why at places with high flow of people it is advisable to use metal detector with the maximum control zone, to be exact metal detectors with flat elongated SE or long cylindrical ( for example, Vortex). But it is also necessary to take in to account, that metal detectors with big control zone have big dimensions compared to compact models. What to look for when choosing a metal detector? when choosing a metal detector for inspection, do not neglect the strength characteristics of metal detector housings. Due to their design features, metal detectors with flat round SE have the lowest mechanical strength, which together with a relatively small control area determined their least popularity in the market of hand-held metal detectors for inspection. In addition, during operation, accidental falls of the metal detector and other mechanical impacts are unavoidable, which can lead to its failure. Therefore, the rigidity and material of the metal detector body play an important role. The metal detector body must be made of high-quality non-brittle material. Metal detectors, whose bodies are made of impact-resistant ABS plastic, have proven themselves well. The more rigid the housing and the stronger the PE is fixed in it, the higher performance can be achieved when developing a metal inspection detector. The technology of manufacture of SE influences not only the durability of the metal detector, but also the stability of operation in general. The best variants of manufacture of SE- means winding of inductors with copper wire on a special reels with a further impregnation with electrical varnish or dumping in to specialized electro technical compound, also manufacture of the inductors as PCB. Besides the improvement of the durability characteristics such technologies enable to increase the stability of operation of the metal detector in general, get rid of false alarms, by the low durability of the SE, and eliminate the influence of moisture and condensate on the SESensitivity The main technical parameter of the hand-held checkup metal detectors is sensitivity- it Is a maximum distance between SE and the surface of the metallic object, on which the current object will be detected. Simply speaking it is a distance at which the metal detector detects a certain object. Dependence of the sensitivity from the size of the object look like this, the bigger the size and mass of the metallic object, the longer the distance at which the metal detector can detect the object and, accordingly, the dimension and mass of the object is small, the smaller the distance this object can and will be detected at all. For comparison of sensitivity of different models of metal detectors, given parameter should accord to the same object of detection. In Russian Federation- it is most likely a Makarov pistol(MP). Depending on the task, for solution of which device is designed, the sensitivity may be in diapason 13-25 cm for the detection of pistol. To ensure security at the entrance groups (search for firearms and cold weapons), a sufficient range is 13-20 cm (sensitivity for the PM pistol). At the same time, there are problems when the objects of detection are various kinds of small metal objects: blades, micro-earphones (exams at school and other educational institutions), microphones and recording devices, SIM cards, needles or small items produced by enterprises. Then the necessary sensitivity range is 20-25 cm for the PM gun, which for the best models of hand-held metal detectors on the market corresponds to 3-5 cm for a razor blade. It is necessary to understand, that high sensitivity without high stability of the device, inference resistance, high diapason of the working temperatures and humidity, will not allow in reality to increase the efficiency of the checkup, and will be just a remarkable note in the description of the device. Only then, when the high algorithm of the exploitation characteristics is achieved in the hand-held metal detector, high sensitivity becomes indisputable advantage in tasks of detection of miniature metallic objects. A very important nuance, when checking people with a hand-held metal detector with high sensitivity are possible false alarms towards human body without metallic object present, due to the fact that the human body has the ability of slight electric conductivity ability. As a fact, the manufacturers of metal detectors warn users about possible false alarms from the human body. Interference immunity Interference immunity – Is the ability of the metal detector to function in the environment with electromagnetic interferences or different types. This parameter became very actual in current time due to increase of devices using certain standards (Wi-Fi, LTE, remote intel gathering devices, etc.). Besides, power units, electric motors, also are a source of strong electromagnetic interference. For example if the control point is at the entrance with the electric doors or near a lift, then the electric motors that control doors and lifts can become a cause of interference and false alarms of the metal detectors, working nearby. Ease of Use Ease of use of hand-held metal detectors is defined by the form ergonomics of the case, controls, weight, dimensions, also possibility of charging without taking out the battery out of the device, if the device is equipped with it. Some manufacturers offer special charging devices, that allow to not just charge the device, but also equip a place where these devices charge and are being kept. Also it is necessary to mention the strap of the metal detector to the belt, which is included in to the delivery set of some devices and eases the exploitation. Special Functions In addition to their main function related to detecting metal objects, almost all hand-held metal detectors are equipped with at least one additional special function. Sometimes manufacturers, in order to limit competition, add far-fetched functionality to their devices that does not affect the quality of inspection in any way. Of all the special functions that exist, the following are really useful when conducting an inspection: -fast way of reducing the sensitivity two times(selectivity)- function allows to assume the dimensions of detected metallic object and decline miniature objects; - one or more adjustable sensitivity levels – the function allows you to set the sensitivity level in accordance with the level of terrorist danger or in accordance with the detected objects (for example, when setting two sensitivity levels, one level is used to search a person, the second level is used for personal belongings); · remote device configuration method (wired or wireless) - this function allows you to exclude errors or intentional illegal actions of the operator when configuring the device; · automatic power off when idle-this function helps you save power if you forget to turn off the device; · switching display modes - this function allows you to select the most convenient way for the operator to display metal detection for specific inspection conditions; · proportional battery discharge indication-this function allows the operator to detect a low battery charge in advance and thus avoid a situation where the metal detector will be inoperable due to lack of charge; Conclusion proportional battery discharge indication-this function allows the operator to detect a low battery charge in advance and thus avoid a situation where the metal detector will be inoperable due to lack of charge.With a variety of models and manufacturers, there is no single universal answer to which manual metal detector has the best price-quality ratio and is suitable for You, since each of the metal detectors solves its specific task. For example, to search for phones on the exam and to ensure the safety of the educational process at school, a metal detector of the average price range (PM sensitivity is 13-16 cm) is suitable, but, on the other hand, there are cases when Universities use manual metal detectors of the highest price range. For example, Lomonosov Moscow state University uses a top-level model to search for micro-earphones for applicants and students. The situation is similar with the removal of products or valuables from enterprises. If the task is to detect large items (parts, metallized food packaging, etc.), then a medium-level device is suitable, and if the buyer is faced with the task of preventing theft, for example, flash memory and other small expensive electronics, then a top-level model is necessary. It also affects the choice of model and climatic conditions of operation (for example, the airfield take-off field), the intensity of inspection, and many other factors. Therefore, the more clearly the task is set for the seller or manufacturer, the more accurate the answer will be, since models of hand-held portable metal detectors have already been created for the vast majority of existing tasks. Summing up, the authors of the article hope that it will be useful for future users of manual inspection metal detectors, who are faced with the task of choosing the means of inspection. Of course, the authors will welcome the opinion of experts and market participants with additions and criticism regarding the facts presented in the article. SOURCE 1. Robert Kingsbury.

The metal detector creates a primary variable electromagnetic field harmless for human. Upon appearance in the primary electromagnetic of an electro-conductive (metal) object in it, the vortex currents create a secondary electromagnetic field, which interacts with the primary one. This change of the electromagnetic field is registered by an electronic scheme and the signal of detection of a metallic object is given out.Usage Up today, hand-held metal detectors are used in many spheres of our lives. For example, in medicine when there is no possibility of conduction of MRI, using hand-held metal detectors unidentified metallic objects can be located in the body of the patient. In archeology and treasure, hunting hand-held metal detectors are used widely for detection of potentially valuable metallic objects in the low conductive environments and soil. In criminalistics metal detectors are used for evidence search and other metallic objects, that can used for successful crime solution. As well, metal detectors are Indespensible in the construction works, for example, in detection of metal wiring in the engineered construction. But the most popular field of use of the hand-held metal detectors is, the ensuring the safety of objects and mass events. With the help of hand-held metal detectors, citizens and their personal belongings are searched in order to identify prohibited metal objects. In addition, the inspection with the use of manual metal detectors is carried out by security guards at passageways of enterprises where there is a high probability of theft of products or production materials( for example, gold mining and gold procession plants/ jewelry companies or companies specializing in production of copper wire). The quality of the inspection is influenced by two key factors: the responsibility of the operator performing the inspection, and the combination of technical and operational characteristics of the hand-held metal detector used. Each of the factors deserves detailed consideration, but in this article we will focus on the latter (for effective use of manual metal detectors, read the rules of inspection in our article &quot;methods of inspection with a manual metal detector&quot;). Depending on the task to be solved during the inspection, the approach to choosing the inspection tool is very important. Let&#039;s find out how to choose a manual metal detector for a specific inspection task that provides the highest quality result at the lowest expense.Technical and exploitation characteristics Any hand-held metal detectors have a variety of technical and exploitation characteristics, which make it usable or unusable for checking in certain situations. Every supplier or seller tries to win over his customer by any means. Sometimes these means are pointed towards confusing of the consumer. The declared by the manufacturer or supplier advantages, at work can be significant disadvantages, that mess with conduction of qualitative checkup. Which of the many characteristics should you pay attention to when choosing a hand-held metal detector?Types of search elements (SE) and durability of the case The search element (primary converter) of the hand- one or several inductors, answering for generation of the electromagnetic field and its fluctuations. Search element as a rule, is set in a separate part of the case of the metal detector and determines its’ area of control (sensitivity diagram) – area of surface of the checked object, covered by the electromagnetic field of the metal detector. Construction of the case and exterior design of the hand-held metal detector, most likely, depends on the type of search element. Up today, the most common types of SE, are: flat elongated, flat round and cylindrical. On pic. 1 shown diagrams of sensitivity for different types of SE. flat elongated flat round Cylindrical cylindrical shortened Pic.1 Types of search elements with sensitivity diagram. As can see, the flat SE have the uneven sensitivity diagram: low frontal sensitivity, high- in direction perpendicular to its flatness. The cylindrical SE has an equal sensitivity diagram around the metal detector case (360°). Besides, current type of SE after detection of the object with a side part of the metal detector, to pinpoint its’ location using the front side. But in overall absolute results at the same length of the SE, the sensitivity of the metal detector with a cylindrical SE is lower, than the flat. That is why the modern high-sensitivity metal detectors are made with flat SE (for example Vortex metal detectors) As mentioned above, the design of the SE defines the control zone of the metal detector, which influences the productivity of the checkup. The wider the control zone, the higher the production. For example, to check a person from the front, using the metal detector with flat elongated SE, it is necessary to make only two passes (pic. 2). a) Flat elongated b) Flat round c)cylindrical d)cylindrical shortened Pic.2 Productivity of checkup using hand-held metal detectors with different types of SE To check out the person from the front using flat round SE three rounds are required( pic.2b) , and if use a compact metal detector with short cylindrical SE – four rounds are necessary (pic.2c). That is why at places with high flow of people it is advisable to use metal detector with the maximum control zone, to be exact metal detectors with flat elongated SE or long cylindrical ( for example, Vortex). But it is also necessary to take in to account, that metal detectors with big control zone have big dimensions compared to compact models. What to look for when choosing a metal detector? when choosing a metal detector for inspection, do not neglect the strength characteristics of metal detector housings. Due to their design features, metal detectors with flat round SE have the lowest mechanical strength, which together with a relatively small control area determined their least popularity in the market of hand-held metal detectors for inspection. In addition, during operation, accidental falls of the metal detector and other mechanical impacts are unavoidable, which can lead to its failure. Therefore, the rigidity and material of the metal detector body play an important role. The metal detector body must be made of high-quality non-brittle material. Metal detectors, whose bodies are made of impact-resistant ABS plastic, have proven themselves well. The more rigid the housing and the stronger the PE is fixed in it, the higher performance can be achieved when developing a metal inspection detector. The technology of manufacture of SE influences not only the durability of the metal detector, but also the stability of operation in general. The best variants of manufacture of SE- means winding of inductors with copper wire on a special reels with a further impregnation with electrical varnish or dumping in to specialized electro technical compound, also manufacture of the inductors as PCB. Besides the improvement of the durability characteristics such technologies enable to increase the stability of operation of the metal detector in general, get rid of false alarms, by the low durability of the SE, and eliminate the influence of moisture and condensate on the SESensitivity The main technical parameter of the hand-held checkup metal detectors is sensitivity- it Is a maximum distance between SE and the surface of the metallic object, on which the current object will be detected. Simply speaking it is a distance at which the metal detector detects a certain object. Dependence of the sensitivity from the size of the object look like this, the bigger the size and mass of the metallic object, the longer the distance at which the metal detector can detect the object and, accordingly, the dimension and mass of the object is small, the smaller the distance this object can and will be detected at all. For comparison of sensitivity of different models of metal detectors, given parameter should accord to the same object of detection. In Russian Federation- it is most likely a Makarov pistol(MP). Depending on the task, for solution of which device is designed, the sensitivity may be in diapason 13-25 cm for the detection of pistol. To ensure security at the entrance groups (search for firearms and cold weapons), a sufficient range is 13-20 cm (sensitivity for the PM pistol). At the same time, there are problems when the objects of detection are various kinds of small metal objects: blades, micro-earphones (exams at school and other educational institutions), microphones and recording devices, SIM cards, needles or small items produced by enterprises. Then the necessary sensitivity range is 20-25 cm for the PM gun, which for the best models of hand-held metal detectors on the market corresponds to 3-5 cm for a razor blade. It is necessary to understand, that high sensitivity without high stability of the device, inference resistance, high diapason of the working temperatures and humidity, will not allow in reality to increase the efficiency of the checkup, and will be just a remarkable note in the description of the device. Only then, when the high algorithm of the exploitation characteristics is achieved in the hand-held metal detector, high sensitivity becomes indisputable advantage in tasks of detection of miniature metallic objects. A very important nuance, when checking people with a hand-held metal detector with high sensitivity are possible false alarms towards human body without metallic object present, due to the fact that the human body has the ability of slight electric conductivity ability. As a fact, the manufacturers of metal detectors warn users about possible false alarms from the human body. Interference immunity Interference immunity – Is the ability of the metal detector to function in the environment with electromagnetic interferences or different types. This parameter became very actual in current time due to increase of devices using certain standards (Wi-Fi, LTE, remote intel gathering devices, etc.). Besides, power units, electric motors, also are a source of strong electromagnetic interference. For example if the control point is at the entrance with the electric doors or near a lift, then the electric motors that control doors and lifts can become a cause of interference and false alarms of the metal detectors, working nearby. Ease of Use Ease of use of hand-held metal detectors is defined by the form ergonomics of the case, controls, weight, dimensions, also possibility of charging without taking out the battery out of the device, if the device is equipped with it. Some manufacturers offer special charging devices, that allow to not just charge the device, but also equip a place where these devices charge and are being kept. Also it is necessary to mention the strap of the metal detector to the belt, which is included in to the delivery set of some devices and eases the exploitation. Special Functions In addition to their main function related to detecting metal objects, almost all hand-held metal detectors are equipped with at least one additional special function. Sometimes manufacturers, in order to limit competition, add far-fetched functionality to their devices that does not affect the quality of inspection in any way. Of all the special functions that exist, the following are really useful when conducting an inspection: -fast way of reducing the sensitivity two times(selectivity)- function allows to assume the dimensions of detected metallic object and decline miniature objects; - one or more adjustable sensitivity levels – the function allows you to set the sensitivity level in accordance with the level of terrorist danger or in accordance with the detected objects (for example, when setting two sensitivity levels, one level is used to search a person, the second level is used for personal belongings); · remote device configuration method (wired or wireless) - this function allows you to exclude errors or intentional illegal actions of the operator when configuring the device; · automatic power off when idle-this function helps you save power if you forget to turn off the device; · switching display modes - this function allows you to select the most convenient way for the operator to display metal detection for specific inspection conditions; · proportional battery discharge indication-this function allows the operator to detect a low battery charge in advance and thus avoid a situation where the metal detector will be inoperable due to lack of charge; Conclusion proportional battery discharge indication-this function allows the operator to detect a low battery charge in advance and thus avoid a situation where the metal detector will be inoperable due to lack of charge.With a variety of models and manufacturers, there is no single universal answer to which manual metal detector has the best price-quality ratio and is suitable for You, since each of the metal detectors solves its specific task. For example, to search for phones on the exam and to ensure the safety of the educational process at school, a metal detector of the average price range (PM sensitivity is 13-16 cm) is suitable, but, on the other hand, there are cases when Universities use manual metal detectors of the highest price range. For example, Lomonosov Moscow state University uses a top-level model to search for micro-earphones for applicants and students. The situation is similar with the removal of products or valuables from enterprises. If the task is to detect large items (parts, metallized food packaging, etc.), then a medium-level device is suitable, and if the buyer is faced with the task of preventing theft, for example, flash memory and other small expensive electronics, then a top-level model is necessary. It also affects the choice of model and climatic conditions of operation (for example, the airfield take-off field), the intensity of inspection, and many other factors. Therefore, the more clearly the task is set for the seller or manufacturer, the more accurate the answer will be, since models of hand-held portable metal detectors have already been created for the vast majority of existing tasks. Summing up, the authors of the article hope that it will be useful for future users of manual inspection metal detectors, who are faced with the task of choosing the means of inspection. Of course, the authors will welcome the opinion of experts and market participants with additions and criticism regarding the facts presented in the article. SOURCE 1. Robert Kingsbury.

									<p>CHOOSING A HAND-HELD METAL DETECTOR FOR INSPECTION<br /><br /> Introduction<br /><br /><strong>History</strong><br /><br /> The history of hand-held metal detectors goes back to the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, when a revolver wounded 20th President of the United States of America, James Abraham Garfield, in 1881. The bullet was lodged in the president’s body, and doctors could not determine its location. Then doctors turned to the scientist Alexander Graham Bell for help, who especially for searching for a bullet, created a first hand-made metal detector.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/President.bmp" alt="President" /><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Metla.bmp" alt="Metla" /><br /><br /> 130 Years have passed since that time, the electronic industry has underwent a couple of industrial revolutions, but the principle of operation has remained the same. <br /><br /><strong>The principle of operation</strong><br /><br /> The majority of hand-held metal detector for inspection use the electromagnetic induction and the effect of vortex currents, the essence of which is as follows. <br /><br /> The metal detector creates a primary variable electromagnetic field harmless for human. Upon appearance in the primary electromagnetic of an electro-conductive (metal) object in it, the vortex currents create a secondary electromagnetic field, which interacts with the primary one. This change of the electromagnetic field is registered by an electronic scheme and the signal of detection of a metallic object is given out.<br /><br /><strong>Usage</strong><br /><br /> Up today, hand-held metal detectors are used in many spheres of our lives. For example, in medicine when there is no possibility of conduction of MRI, using hand-held metal detectors unidentified metallic objects can be located in the body of the patient. In archeology and treasure, hunting hand-held metal detectors are used widely for detection of potentially valuable metallic objects in the low conductive environments and soil. In criminalistics metal detectors are used for evidence search and other metallic objects, that can used for successful crime solution. As well, metal detectors are Indespensible in the construction works, for example, in detection of metal wiring in the engineered construction. But the most popular field of use of the hand-held metal detectors is, the ensuring the safety of objects and mass events. With the help of hand-held metal detectors, citizens and their personal belongings are searched in order to identify prohibited metal objects. In addition, the inspection with the use of manual metal detectors is carried out by security guards at passageways of enterprises where there is a high probability of theft of products or production materials( for example, gold mining and gold procession plants/ jewelry companies or companies specializing in production of copper wire). <br /><br /> The quality of the inspection is influenced by two key factors: the responsibility of the operator performing the inspection, and the combination of technical and operational characteristics of the hand-held metal detector used. Each of the factors deserves detailed consideration, but in this article we will focus on the latter (for effective use of manual metal detectors, read the rules of inspection in our article "methods of inspection with a manual metal detector"). Depending on the task to be solved during the inspection, the approach to choosing the inspection tool is very important. Let's find out how to choose a manual metal detector for a specific inspection task that provides the highest quality result at the lowest expense.<br /><br /><strong>Technical and exploitation characteristics</strong> <br /><br /> Any hand-held metal detectors have a variety of technical and exploitation characteristics, which make it usable or unusable for checking in certain situations. Every supplier or seller tries to win over his customer by any means. Sometimes these means are pointed towards confusing of the consumer. The declared by the manufacturer or supplier advantages, at work can be significant disadvantages, that mess with conduction of qualitative checkup. Which of the many characteristics should you pay attention to when choosing a hand-held metal detector?<br /><br /><strong>Types of search elements (SE) and durability of the case</strong><br /><br /> The search element (primary converter) of the hand- one or several inductors, answering for generation of the electromagnetic field and its fluctuations. Search element as a rule, is set in a separate part of the case of the metal detector and determines its’ area of control (sensitivity diagram) – area of surface of the checked object, covered by the electromagnetic field of the metal detector. Construction of the case and exterior design of the hand-held metal detector, most likely, depends on the type of search element. Up today, the most common types of SE, are: flat elongated, flat round and cylindrical. On pic. 1 shown diagrams of sensitivity for different types of SE.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Type_1.bmp" alt="Type_1" />flat elongated</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Type_2.bmp" alt="Type_2" />flat round</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Type_3.bmp" alt="Type_3" />Cylindrical</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Type_4.bmp" alt="Type_4" />cylindrical shortened</p>
<p>Pic.1 Types of search elements with sensitivity diagram. <br /><br /> As can see, the flat SE have the uneven sensitivity diagram: low frontal sensitivity, high- in direction perpendicular to its flatness. The cylindrical SE has an equal sensitivity diagram around the metal detector case (360°). Besides, current type of SE after detection of the object with a side part of the metal detector, to pinpoint its’ location using the front side. But in overall absolute results at the same length of the SE, the sensitivity of the metal detector with a cylindrical SE is lower, than the flat. That is why the modern high-sensitivity metal detectors are made with flat SE (for example Vortex metal detectors) <br /><br /> As mentioned above, the design of the SE defines the control zone of the metal detector, which influences the productivity of the checkup. The wider the control zone, the higher the production. For example, to check a person from the front, using the metal detector with flat elongated SE, it is necessary to make only two passes (pic. 2).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Type_S1.bmp" alt="Type_S1" />a) Flat elongated</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Type_S2.bmp" alt="Type_S2" />b) Flat round</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #525252;">Pic.2 Productivity of checkup using hand-held metal detectors with different types of SE</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #525252;"> To check out the person from the front using flat round SE three rounds are required( pic.2b) , and if use a compact metal detector with short cylindrical SE – four rounds are necessary (pic.2c). That is why at places with high flow of people it is advisable to use metal detector with the maximum control zone, to be exact metal detectors with flat elongated SE or long cylindrical ( for example, Vortex). But it is also necessary to take in to account, that metal detectors with big control zone have big dimensions compared to compact models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: #525252;"><strong>What to look for when choosing a metal detector?</strong><br /><br /> when choosing a metal detector for inspection, do not neglect the strength characteristics of metal detector housings. Due to their design features, metal detectors with flat round SE have the lowest mechanical strength, which together with a relatively small control area determined their least popularity in the market of hand-held metal detectors for inspection. In addition, during operation, accidental falls of the metal detector and other mechanical impacts are unavoidable, which can lead to its failure. Therefore, the rigidity and material of the metal detector body play an important role. The metal detector body must be made of high-quality non-brittle material. Metal detectors, whose bodies are made of impact-resistant ABS plastic, have proven themselves well. The more rigid the housing and the stronger the PE is fixed in it, the higher performance can be achieved when developing a metal inspection detector.<br /><br /> The technology of manufacture of SE influences not only the durability of the metal detector, but also the stability of operation in general. The best variants of manufacture of SE- means winding of inductors with copper wire on a special reels with a further impregnation with electrical varnish or dumping in to specialized electro technical compound, also manufacture of the inductors as PCB.<br /><br /> Besides the improvement of the durability characteristics such technologies enable to increase the stability of operation of the metal detector in general, get rid of false alarms, by the low durability of the SE, and eliminate the influence of moisture and condensate on the SE<br /><br /><strong>Sensitivity</strong><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The main technical parameter of the hand-held checkup metal detectors is sensitivity- it Is a maximum distance between SE and the surface of the metallic object, on which the current object will be detected. Simply speaking it is a distance at which the metal detector detects a certain object. &nbsp;Dependence of the sensitivity from the size of the object look like this, the bigger the size and mass of the metallic object, the longer the distance at which the metal detector can detect the object and, accordingly, the dimension and mass of the object is small, the smaller the distance this object can and will be detected at all.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://www.selcomsecurity.com/images/Weapons.bmp" alt="Weapons" /></p>
<p>For comparison of sensitivity of different models of metal detectors, given parameter should accord to the same object of detection. In Russian Federation- it is most likely a Makarov pistol(MP). Depending on the task, for solution of which device is designed, the sensitivity may be in diapason 13-25 cm for the detection of pistol.<br /><br /> To ensure security at the entrance groups (search for firearms and cold weapons), a sufficient range is 13-20 cm (sensitivity for the PM pistol). At the same time, there are problems when the objects of detection are various kinds of small metal objects: blades, micro-earphones (exams at school and other educational institutions), microphones and recording devices, SIM cards, needles or small items produced by enterprises. Then the necessary sensitivity range is 20-25 cm for the PM gun, which for the best models of hand-held metal detectors on the market corresponds to 3-5 cm for a razor blade.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> It is necessary to understand, that high sensitivity without high stability of the device, inference resistance, high diapason of the working temperatures and humidity, will not allow in reality to increase the efficiency of the checkup, and will be just a remarkable note in the description of the device. Only then, when the high algorithm of the exploitation characteristics is achieved in the hand-held metal detector, high sensitivity becomes indisputable advantage in tasks of detection of miniature metallic objects. &nbsp;<br /><br /> A very important nuance, when checking people with a hand-held metal detector with high sensitivity are possible false alarms towards human body without metallic object present, due to the fact that the human body has the ability of slight electric conductivity ability. As a fact, the manufacturers of metal detectors warn users about possible false alarms from the human body. <br /><br /><strong>Interference immunity</strong><br /><br /> Interference immunity – Is the ability of the metal detector to function in the environment with electromagnetic interferences or different types. This parameter became very actual in current time due to increase of devices using certain standards (Wi-Fi, LTE, remote intel gathering devices, etc.). Besides, power units, electric motors, also are a source of strong electromagnetic interference. For example if the control point is at the entrance with the electric doors or near a lift, then the electric motors that control doors and lifts can become a cause of interference and false alarms of the metal detectors, working nearby. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Ease of Use</strong><br /><br /> Ease of use of hand-held metal detectors is defined by the form ergonomics of the case, controls, weight, dimensions, also possibility of charging without taking out the battery out of the device, if the device is equipped with it. Some manufacturers offer special charging devices, that allow to not just charge the device, but also equip a place where these devices charge and are being kept. <br /><br /> Also it is necessary to mention the strap of the metal detector to the belt, which is included in to the delivery set of some devices and eases the exploitation. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Special Functions</strong><br /><br /> In addition to their main function related to detecting metal objects, almost all hand-held metal detectors are equipped with at least one additional special function. Sometimes manufacturers, in order to limit competition, add far-fetched functionality to their devices that does not affect the quality of inspection in any way. Of all the special functions that exist, the following are really useful when conducting an inspection:<br /><br /> -fast way of reducing the sensitivity two times(selectivity)- function allows to assume the dimensions of detected metallic object and decline miniature objects;<br /><br /> - one or more adjustable sensitivity levels – the function allows you to set the sensitivity level in accordance with the level of terrorist danger or in accordance with the detected objects (for example, when setting two sensitivity levels, one level is used to search a person, the second level is used for personal belongings);<br /><br /> · remote device configuration method (wired or wireless) - this function allows you to exclude errors or intentional illegal actions of the operator when configuring the device;<br /><br /> · automatic power off when idle-this function helps you save power if you forget to turn off the device;<br /><br /> · switching display modes - this function allows you to select the most convenient way for the operator to display metal detection for specific inspection conditions;<br /><br /> · proportional battery discharge indication-this function allows the operator to detect a low battery charge in advance and thus avoid a situation where the metal detector will be inoperable due to lack of charge;<br /><br /> <br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong><br /><br /> proportional battery discharge indication-this function allows the operator to detect a low battery charge in advance and thus avoid a situation where the metal detector will be inoperable due to lack of charge.With a variety of models and manufacturers, there is no single universal answer to which manual metal detector has the best price-quality ratio and is suitable for You, since each of the metal detectors solves its specific task.<br /><br /> For example, to search for phones on the exam and to ensure the safety of the educational process at school, a metal detector of the average price range (PM sensitivity is 13-16 cm) is suitable, but, on the other hand, there are cases when Universities use manual metal detectors of the highest price range. For example, Lomonosov Moscow state University uses a top-level model to search for micro-earphones for applicants and students.<br /><br /> The situation is similar with the removal of products or valuables from enterprises. If the task is to detect large items (parts, metallized food packaging, etc.), then a medium-level device is suitable, and if the buyer is faced with the task of preventing theft, for example, flash memory and other small expensive electronics, then a top-level model is necessary.<br /><br /> It also affects the choice of model and climatic conditions of operation (for example, the airfield take-off field), the intensity of inspection, and many other factors. Therefore, the more clearly the task is set for the seller or manufacturer, the more accurate the answer will be, since models of hand-held portable metal detectors have already been created for the vast majority of existing tasks.<br /><br /> Summing up, the authors of the article hope that it will be useful for future users of manual inspection metal detectors, who are faced with the task of choosing the means of inspection.<br /><br /> <span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Of course, the authors will welcome the opinion of experts and market participants with additions and criticism regarding the facts presented in the article.</span></p>
